# Advent of Code 2024 - TypeScript with Deno

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 solutions! This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024, written in TypeScript, and executed using the Deno runtime.

## About

Advent of Code is an annual event in December, where participants are given programming challenges to solve. The challenges become progressively more difficult, and solutions can be implemented in any language. This repository includes my personal solutions to the daily challenges using TypeScript, powered by the Deno runtime.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the code, make sure you have [Deno](https://deno.land/) installed on your system.

You can install Deno by following the instructions on the official website:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
